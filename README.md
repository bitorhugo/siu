## Folder Structure

The workspace contains four folders where:

- `src/main`: the folder to maintain source code
- `src/test`: the folder to maintain code tests
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `UML`: the folder to maintain Unified Modeling Language diagrams

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
