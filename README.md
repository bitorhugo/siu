## Folder Structure

The workspace contains five (5) folders where:

- `data`: the folder to store data
- `src/main`: the folder to maintain source code
- `src/test`: the folder to maintain code tests
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `UML`: the folder to maintain Unified Modeling Language diagrams

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Design Patterns

MVC : first time implementing mvc..  
        `Model`: where data is pulled from  
        `View` : what the client sees (GUI)  
        `Controller` : bridge between the data and client | handles the business logic  

Facade : masks the complexity of the code, improving its readability
